# simple-preact-ssr-boilerplate

So i didn't manage to find any simple preact ssr boilerplates.Most of what could be found looked
overcomplicated.

# Start

  - For development start "build:client-dev" and then "start:ssr-server-dev" in separate terminal
  - prod - run "prod" command


# Todo
    - Typescript maybe?
    - SSR codespliting  
      (doubt I can manage it without hacks now). At least I can deactivate SSR for some routes.
