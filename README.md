# simple-preact-ssr-boilerplate

So i didn't manage to find any simple preact ssr boilerplates.Most of could be found looked
overcomplicated.

# How to

There are several commands

 - dev - hotreload devserver without ssr
 - build:client/build:server - builts resources
 - prod - build everything and runs it with SSR in production mod
 - analyze - analyze client side bundle

# Todo

    - Typescript maybe?
    - Lighter routing module
    - SSR codespliting  (doubt I can manage it without hacks now)
